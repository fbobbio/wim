WIM
===

Test project for the [Weight in Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weigh_in_motion) Technology developed at INTI CÃ³rdoba.

This module would work as the web-mobile application for the controllers at the WIM installation site.
That way they can analyze the suspicious vehicles and send the report inmediatly to the Static Site for further checks.
